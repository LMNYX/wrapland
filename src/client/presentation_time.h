/**
 * @short Wrapper for the wp_presentation interface.
 *
 * This class provides a convenient wrapper for the wp_presentation interface.
 *
 * To use this class one needs to interact with the Registry. There are two
 * possible ways to create the PresentationManager interface:
 * @code
 * PresentationManager *c = registry->createPresentationManager(name, version);
 * @endcode
 *
 * This creates the PresentationManager and sets it up directly. As an alternative this
 * can also be done in a more low level way:
 * @code
 * PresentationManager *c = new PresentationManager;
 * c->setup(registry->bindPresentationManager(name, version));
 * @endcode
 *
 * The PresentationManager can be used as a drop-in replacement for any wp_presentation
 * pointer as it provides matching cast operators.
 *
 * @see Registry
